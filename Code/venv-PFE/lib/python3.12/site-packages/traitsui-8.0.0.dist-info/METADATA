============================================
TraitsUI: Traits-capable windowing framework
============================================

The TraitsUI project provides a toolkit-independent GUI abstraction layer,
which is used to support the "visualization" features of the
`Traits <http://github.com/enthought/traits>`__ package.
You can write a model using the Traits API and specify a GUI using the TraitsUI
API (views, items, editors, etc.), and let TraitsUI and your selected toolkit
back-end (Qt or Wx) take care of the details of displaying them.

Example
-------

Given a Traits model like the following::

    from traits.api import HasTraits, Str, Range, Enum

    class Person(HasTraits):
        name = Str('Jane Doe')
        age = Range(low=0)
        gender = Enum('female', 'male')

    person = Person(age=30)

And using TraitsUI to specify and display a GUI view::

    from traitsui.api import Item, RangeEditor, View

    person_view = View(
        Item('name'),
        Item('gender'),
        Item('age', editor=RangeEditor(mode='spinner', low=0, high=150)),
        buttons=['OK', 'Cancel'],
        resizable=True,
    )

    person.configure_traits(view=person_view)

It creates a GUI which looks like this:

Installation
------------

If you want to run traitsui, you must also install:

- Traits `<https://github.com/enthought/traits>`__
- Pyface `<https://github.com/enthought/pyface>`__

You will also need one of the following backends:

- wxPython
- PySide2
- PyQt5

Backends have additional dependencies and there are optional dependencies on
NumPy and Pandas for some editors.

TraitsUI along with all dependencies can be installed in a straightforward way
using the `Enthought Deployment Manager <http://docs.enthought.com/edm/>`__,
``pip`` or other package managers.

Running the Test Suite
----------------------

To run the test suite, you will need to install Git and
`EDM <http://docs.enthought.com/edm/>`__ as well as have a Python environment
which has install `Click <http://click.pocoo.org/>`__ available. You can then
follow the instructions in ``etstool.py``.  In particular::

    > python etstool.py test_all

will run tests in all supported environments automatically.
